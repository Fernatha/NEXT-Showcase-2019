# NEXT-Showcase-2019
My entry for the 2019 Ubisoft NEXT challenge

This is the code i submitted for the showcase. please note that my code is an addition to the api i was given, 
i personally setup the player/enemy classes, made slight modifications to the StaticTileMap class, 
and massive changes to the GameTest.cpp file

if you want to test and run the game, make sure to run in admin mode and retarget solution.
